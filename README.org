not sure which file will load first.
these 3 files weave together, to make sure put all 
package custom variable and config to .spacemacs.el. config.el just
be used to put your global var. 
or something you need to sure it
will exec before spacemacs.el. 
THe same with funcs, just use it with configs need
to sure will exec before config.el
